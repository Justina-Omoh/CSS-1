        <h2><b>My love for Tech</b></h2>
        <p>Imagine having to write a letter to your friend, wait like a month for it to arrive, then
            another month to get a reply! Now imagine having to go through all that even if you
            don’t enjoy reading or writing! And there you are wondering why to love technology!
            Enough said! Think about it the next time you grab your phone and take time to notice
            how much easier it is for us now to keep in touch with friends and family, even if they live
            on a different side of the globe.
            </p>
            <p>Technology helps us organize your life and work better, allows you to access information the moment you need it, 
            helps you buy and sell stuff easier, enables you to find the best price for the items you need. Time is money, 
            let’s not forget that. This is why i love Tech</p>

            <h2> <i>CSS</i></h2>
            <h2><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b></h2>

            In short, CSS is a design language that
            makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text.
            Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual
            structure, layout, and aesthetics. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style
            sheet language</p>
            <h3><b>Importance of CSS</b></h3>
            <p>If HTML were the engine components of a car, CSS would be the body style and
            the paint job. A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn’t pretty. CSS
            makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.
            Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder. CSS allows for responsiveness, 
            easy formatting and faster page speed.</p>

        <h2> <i>The Differences</i></h2>
        <h2><b>Paddings, Margins and Borders</b></h2>
    
    <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is the space outside the border.
        Border is the strip that goes around the div/element of the content. </p>
        <p>Imagine that you have a set of framed and matted photographs hanging on a wall.
        Each photo is surrounded by a mat that puts space between the photo and the frame. That space would be the padding.

        The frame encloses the mat and the image. That would be the border.

        Each picture has a set amount of space around the outside. That is the margin. If two pictures are handing side 
        by side with four inches between them, then we might say that they each have a two inch margin. 
        The margin is the distance between an element and something else</p>
